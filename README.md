# CPU Scheduler Simulator  
A Python-based CPU scheduling simulator that visualizes different scheduling algorithms.  

## Features  
- Supports FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling.  
- Generates Gantt charts for visualization.  
- Calculates performance metrics (waiting time, turnaround time).  

## How to Run  
1. Install Python 3 and required libraries (`matplotlib`, `tkinter`).  
2. Run `main.py` to start the simulator.
